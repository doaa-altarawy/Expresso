# Expresso
Expresso is a web server designed to identify and explore the binding of transcription factors to their target genes in plants using available ChIP-Seq data.

Link to the server: http://bioinformatics.cs.vt.edu/expresso/

# Services available:

* Search for a transcription factor and identify its target genes in the Expresso database.
* Search for selected target genes and identify their candidate transcription factors based on available ChIP-Seq data.
* Upload your own gene expression data in order to identify highly correlating pairs of transcription factors and inferred targets genes.
